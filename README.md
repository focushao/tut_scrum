   # Scrum Flow Overview

## 1. Tickets and Story Points
- Tickets represent work items (user stories, tasks, bugs)
- Story Points use Fibonacci sequence: **1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21**
- Points measure relative effort, complexity, and uncertainty
- Higher points = more complex work (should be broken down)
